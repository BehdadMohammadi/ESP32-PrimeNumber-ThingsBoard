# ESP32 Prime Number ThingsBoard Project

This project demonstrates how to use **FreeRTOS tasks** on an **ESP32** to generate prime numbers and send them to **ThingsBoard Cloud** via HTTP.  
It includes two concurrent tasks:
1. **Prime Number Generator Task** – continuously finds prime numbers.
2. **HTTP Sender Task** – sends prime numbers to the ThingsBoard telemetry API.
